# CS50Python

Set of Python files that I generated while watching CS50 2019 - Lecture 6 - Python
on YouTube at:

The files differ from the original files used / generated by the instructor David Malan.

The following URI is for my comments on the files:

Hope you enjoy taking the course and experimenting with Python as much as I did.
